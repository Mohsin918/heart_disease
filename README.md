Supervised algorithms are used for the early prediction of heart disease. Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is the widely used lazy classification algorithm. KNN is the most popular, effective and efficient algorithm used for pattern recognition. Medical data sets contain a large number of features.
We got the dataset from the kaggle.
This Algorithm gives an accuracy of 85%.
